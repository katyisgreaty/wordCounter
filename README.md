# Word Counter

#### _Count how many times a word appears_

#### By _**Katy Daviscourt**_

## Description

This web application will take an inputted word from the user and check how many times that word appears in a phrase also inputted by the user.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Requires DNU, DNX, and Mono
* Clone to local machine
* Use command "dnu restore" in command prompt/shell
* Use command "dnx kestrel" to start server
* Navigate to http://localhost:5004 in web browser of choice

## Specifications

**The program will return the inputted phrase and word.**
* Example Input: "this is a phrase", "pickle"
* Example Output: "this is a phrase", "pickle"
* Reasoning: I first want to make sure that my program can recognize both of the inputs, because it will need to be able to manipulate them later on.
